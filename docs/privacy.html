      <h1>Privacy Policy (LitSpark)</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-12-28</p>

      <p>
        LitSpark (“the app”) is a lightweight, offline-first app that shows short
        literary excerpts and lets you share them. This Privacy Policy explains
        what information is handled when you use the app.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No account, no signup.</li>
        <li>Core content is offline (bundled with the app).</li>
        <li>Small local-only data for streaks and ad frequency.</li>
        <li>
          Ads (mobile only): uses Google AdMob (Google Mobile Ads SDK) on Android/iOS.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <h3>Information you provide</h3>
      <p>
        We do not ask you to provide personal information (such as your name,
        email address, phone number, or contacts) to use the app.
      </p>

      <h3>Information stored on your device (local storage)</h3>
      <p>The app stores small pieces of data only on your device, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your current reading streak (a number)</li>
        <li>The last day the app was opened (a day key)</li>
        <li>The last day an interstitial ad was shown (a day key)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This information is used solely to provide app features and to limit ad
        frequency.
      </p>

      <h3>Advertising data (Google AdMob)</h3>
      <p>
        If you use the app on Android or iOS, the app may show ads via Google AdMob.
        Google may collect device and usage information to deliver and measure ads.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy</li>
        <li>Google Advertising: https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Information we share</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information. We do not share personal information
        with third parties except as needed to provide ads on mobile platforms through
        Google AdMob.
      </p>

      <h2>Sharing features</h2>
      <p>
        When you tap Share, the app uses your device’s system share sheet to send text
        or an image to another app you choose.
      </p>

      <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>
        LitSpark is a general-audience app and is not intended to be directed to
        children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
        children under 13.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to list the app as targeting children under 13, you may need to
        configure your advertising and app settings to comply with COPPA and Google
        Play’s policies.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        Local streak/ad-gate data remains on your device until you clear the app’s
        storage or uninstall the app. Advertising-related data retention is governed
        by Google’s policies.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the effective date
        when changes are made.
